Subject: Web Design Request for an Automotive Services Application

Hello,

I'm reaching out today to request your services for UX/UI design for a mobile application.

The main purpose of the app is to enable users to book fuel deliveries to a specific address and to schedule appointments for vehicle maintenance or repairs with garages.

The concept is modeled on the simplicity and user-friendliness of the Uber mobile app, with a minimalist design approach.

Here are the various screens I need:

- **Homepage Design**: The homepage should provide quick access to various services. It should be clear, intuitive, and easy to navigate, allowing quick access to the Services page and a few suggested repairs. Similar to Uber, the user should have quick access to their addresses, which when clicked, will redirect them to the refueling form.

- **Services Page**: This page will list all the services we offer, including fuel refilling, maintenance, emergency assistance, and vehicle repairs. The design should allow users to easily browse and select these services. All proposed repairs will be listed here.

- **Emergency Services**: A dedicated section for emergency services, with two buttons, one to indicate a breakdown, the other to indicate an accident.

- **Refueling Form**: A form where the user can select the type of fuel, the volume, the number of vehicles, and enter their address.

- **Repair Form**: A form where the user can choose which vehicle they need repaired, choose from the proposed garages, and select a date according to a schedule provided by the garage.

- **User History Page**: This page will display the user's past activities, including bookings and repairs. It should be organized and easy to consult, displaying the type of service, upcoming and past appointments, date, address, and price.

- **User Profile Page**: Users should be able to access and modify their personal information, addresses, and vehicle details, as well as access legal notices and company information. The layout should be user-friendly and secure.

- **User Profile Update Form**: A form where users can update their information, change their name, first name, email, phone number, and associate their company if they own one.

We desire a modern and sleek graphic charter, centered around blue in line with the logo. Attached, you will find a mockup of the developed application to help you better visualize and understand the project.

I would appreciate if you could provide a design that meets these requirements. Your experience and skills would be invaluable in bringing this application to life.
